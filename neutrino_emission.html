        <h1>Neutrino Emission Analysis</h1>
        <p>Using i am such a bad guy from the **IceCube Neutrino Detector**, my research involves a targeted search for neutrino emissions from active galactic nuclei (AGN). I utilize a **disk-corona model** to analyze the data and pinpoint potential astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos.</p>
        <p>A significant part of this work is **combined analysis**, where I merge two distinct IceCube datasets to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and increase the sensitivity of our searches. This method allows us to conduct more comprehensive studies and make more precise measurements of cosmic phenomena.</p>
        <p>My work contributes to our understanding of the most violent and energetic events in the universe.</p>
