                        <div class="about-text">
                            <p>I am a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the <strong>University of Utah</strong>, 
                                where my research spans multiple, dynamic fields. I am deeply involved in projects with Professor <strong>Carsten Rott</strong> and 
                                Professor <strong>Shiqi Yu</strong>, focusing on renewable energy solutions and advanced neutrino search analysis. My academic journey 
                                began at <strong>Tribhuvan University</strong> in Nepal, where I completed my bachelor's degree in 2019. During my undergraduate studies, 
                                I delved into various research areas, including the environment surrounding <strong>Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)</strong> stars, a study 
                                on solar wind using data from the <strong>Parker Solar Probe (PSP)</strong>, and an investigation into geomagnetic activity. 
                                These early experiences fueled my passion for data analysis and statistics. My current Ph.D. research includes the exploration of cosmic 
                                phenomena with the help of machine learning. I work with Professor Shiqi Yu and undergraduate <strong>Ryan</strong> on a project aimed 
                                at sorting new catalogs of <strong>Seyfert galaxies</strong> using data from various X-ray telescopes. We leverage the power of <strong>transformer 
                                machine learning models</strong> to efficiently classify these galaxies and perform a subsequent search for neutrino emissions. This research is crucial 
                                for identifying new astrophysical sources and expanding our understanding of high-energy neutrinos.</p>
                            <p>In collaboration with Professor Carsten Rott and <strong>Vedant Basu</strong>, my work also focuses on renewable energy solutions for the next-generation 
                                <strong>IceCube Neutrino Detector (IceCube-Gen2)</strong>. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study to power the new detector with 
                                sustainable energy. Our research combines extensive <strong>simulation-based analysis</strong> with on-site <strong>field tests</strong>. This approach 
                                allows us to understand the power output from solar panels under diverse environmental conditions. In August 2024, we took a significant step by shipping 
                                four <strong>bifacial solar panels</strong> to the South Pole. This setup will provide invaluable data on their performance in a uniquely harsh and highly 
                                reflective environment. We expect the setup to be completed by January 2026. This initiative not only supports the IceCube-Gen2 project but also helps us 
                                understand the logistical and physical challenges of deploying technology in such an extreme climate.</p>

                <p>My research expands across three distinct areas. Click on a link in the sidebar to view a detailed description of each field.</p>

                <span class="back-to-research">&larr; Back to Research</span>
                <h2>Solar Panels & Renewable Energy</h2>
                <p>For the next-generation South Pole Experiment, my work focuses on a feasibility study of renewable energy at the South Pole. 
                   The primary focus is on solar panels, but the research also includes wind power as a secondary source.</p>
                <p>My research involves both **field testing** and **large-scale simulations** to determine the viability 
                    and optimal design for a renewable energy system in the extreme polar environment. This work is critical for 
                    ensuring the sustainability and efficiency of future scientific endeavors at the pole.</p>

            <section id="neutrino-analysis" class="content-section hidden">
                <span class="back-to-research">&larr; Back to Research</span>
                <h2>Neutrino Emission Analysis</h2>
                <p>Using data from the **IceCube Neutrino Detector**, my research involves a targeted search for neutrino emissions 
                    from active galactic nuclei (AGN). I utilize a **disk-corona model** to analyze the data and pinpoint potential astrophysical 
                    sources of high-energy neutrinos.</p>
                <p>A significant part of this work is **combined analysis**, where I merge two distinct IceCube datasets to improve the signal-to-noise 
                    ratio and increase the sensitivity of our searches. This method allows us to conduct more comprehensive studies and make more precise 
                    measurements of cosmic phenomena.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="machine-learning" class="content-section hidden">
                <span class="back-to-research">&larr; Back to Research</span>
                <h2>Machine Learning in Physics</h2>
                <p>My research also extends to the application of **machine learning (ML)** techniques to enhance both of my primary research fields. 
                    For the solar panel feasibility study, I use ML models to predict energy generation based on weather patterns and environmental data.</p>
                <p>In neutrino analysis, I develop ML algorithms to more efficiently identify and classify neutrino events within the vast datasets collected by IceCube. 
                    This approach helps to filter out background noise and focus on the most scientifically valuable events.</p>
