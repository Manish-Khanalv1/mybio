    <h2>Solar Panels & Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>For the next-generation South Pole Experiment, my work focuses on a feasibility study 
        of renewable energy at the South Pole. The primary focus is on solar panels, but the 
        research also includes wind power as a secondary source.</p>
    <p>My research involves both **field testing** and **large-scale simulations** to 
        determine the viability and optimal design for a renewable energy system in the 
        extreme polar environment. This work is critical for ensuring the sustainability 
        and efficiency of future scientific endeavors at the pole.</p>
    <p>This project aims to provide a reliable power source for advanced detectors, 
        minimizing the reliance on traditional fuel-based power generation.</p>
